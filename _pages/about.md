As a researcher in machine learning, I am interested in methodologies that enable efficient probabilistic inference, causal graphical model learning, and explainable AI and its applications. In my current work, I am focused on Bayesian network inference, causal structure learning, knowledge discovery, and applications in the medical and finance industries. I am also an algorithm developer for AgenaRisk Ltd. I received my PhD in computer science from Queen Mary U. of London, supervised by Prof. Martin Neil and Prof. Norman Fenton.



Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
