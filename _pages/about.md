As a machine learning researcher, I am interested in methodologies that enable efficient probabilistic inference, causal graphical model learning, and explainable AI and its applications. My current work focuses on Bayesian network inference, causal structure learning, knowledge discovery, and applications in the medical and finance industries. I received my PhD in computer science from Queen Mary University of London, where I was supervised by Prof. Martin Neil and Prof. Norman Fenton. 
Currently, I am an Associate Professor at the School of Statistics at Capital University of Economics and Business.
