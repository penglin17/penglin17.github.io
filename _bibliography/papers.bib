abstract={Exact inference for large, directed graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks (BNs), can be intractable as the space complexity grows exponentially in the tree-width of the model. Approximate inference, such as generalized belief propagation (GBP), is used instead. GBP treats inference as the Bethe/Kikuchi energy function optimization problem. The solution is found using iterative message passing, which is inefficient and convergent problematic. Recent progress on amortized technique for GBP is an attractive alternative solution that can optimize the Bethe/Kikuchi energy function using (deep) neural networks, requiring no message passing. Despite being efficient, the amortized technique for GBP is applied to undirected graphical models with specific structures and factors, with no guarantee of the approximation quality. This is because the energy function to be amortized is defined by a region (or factor) graph that is ad hoc and difficult to construct to ensure sensible approximations. This paper proposes a new amortized GBP algorithm applied to BN for efficient inference. The proposed algorithm is composed of the following: (i) a new pairwise conversion (PWC) algorithm that converts all the conditional probability distributions in the BN into pairwise factors to facilitate efficient region graph constructions; (ii) following PWC, an improved loop structured region graph (LSRG) algorithm was derived to generate a valid region graph satisfying desired regional properties; and (iii) the energy function defined by the proposed PWC-LSRG region graph can be directly amortized using (deep) neural networks to ensure sensible approximations. Empirical studies show that the proposed amortized PWC-LSRG algorithm is of practical use and significantly improves convergence and efficiency compared to conventional algorithms.},

abstract = {Abstract The partition function Ƶ \${\boldsymbol{\&\#437;}}\$ is a normalization constant for normalizing all the distributions in probabilistic inference. Ƶ \${\boldsymbol{\&\#437;}}\$ is closely related to the log probability of evidence (log  p ( e ) \$\mathrm{log}\unicode{x0200A}p(e)\$) for Bayesian networks (BNs), which plays an important role in many applications, such as parameter learning, classification, and clustering. However, evaluating Ƶ \${\boldsymbol{\&\#437;}}\$ and log  p ( e ) \$\mathrm{log}\unicode{x0200A}p(e)\$ for BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables (known as hybrid Bayesian networks [HBNs]) is generally difficult for analytical and simulation-based solutions. This paper describes the work addressing the problem of estimating the partition function for HBNs when exact methods become inefficient or numerically unstable. We use dynamic discretization to provide a discretized version of the model and then perform region-based free energy optimization to obtain the log  p ( e ) \$\mathrm{log}\unicode{x0200A}p(e)\$ for the HBN efficiently, which is called the DDJT-region partition function (RPR) algorithm. It is novel since the region-based methods have previously only been applied to discrete BNs. We show that the log  p ( e ) \$\mathrm{log}\unicode{x0200A}p(e)\$ obtained by DDJT-RPR is exact for discretized models and with space complexity equal to that in marginal inference, thus generally applicable to a wide range of applications. To demonstrate these properties, we combine the DDJT-RPR algorithm with an improved expectation-maximization algorithm to learn Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), for applications requiring data only and with prior knowledge, which performed more robustly than conventional GMM learning algorithms.},

abstract = {Performing efficient inference on high dimensional discrete Bayesian Networks (BNs)is challenging.  When using exact inference methods the space complexity can grow exponentially with the tree-width, thus making computation intractable.  This paper presents a general purpose approximate inference algorithm, based on a new region belief approximation method, called Triplet Region Construction (TRC). TRC reduces the cluster space complexity for factorized models from worst-case exponential to polynomial by performing graph factorization and producing clusters of limited size.  Unlike previous generations of region-based algorithms,  TRC is guaranteed to converge and effectively addresses the region choice problem that bedevils other region-based algorithms used for BN inference. Our experiments demonstrate that it also achieves significantly more accurate results than competing algorithm},
